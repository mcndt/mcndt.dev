As university graduation quickly approaches (t-minus five months!), I find myself preparing interviews for grad-level **software engineering positions**.

At the end of the interview,  there is usually some time reserved for questions you might have about the role or the company. I have always been quite flustered by this question, as I just spent 30-60 minutes in answering mode and am suddenly asked to reverse roles. It usually ends with me saying “not really!” and the interview ending at that.

To learn more about the company culture and see if I can fit in the work environment, I created this list of questions to prepare for future interviews. Some questions are my own, but many are sourced from Hacker News, GitHub, or other blog posts. You can find the sources at the end of the post.

The main goal of these questions is to avoid nasty surprises about the job after I start my employment. This list is quite extensive, so you can pick and choose the questions that seem most important to you or that segue the best during the conversation with the interviewer.

Also, if you are particularly interested in **diversity and equity** at a company, I highly recommend you read [this post by Charity](https://charity.wtf/2022/01/29/how-can-you-tell-if-the-company-youre-interviewing-with-is-rotten-on-the-inside/) with specific questions to ask about this topic.

## Questions for team members


Talking to a potential future colleague is the best opportunity to get an honest view of the company. They are more likely to give you an honest take compared to an interviewer whose main objective is to recruit you.

Before you sign a contract, it is a great idea to ask if you can talk to one of your future team members, or check your network for contacts who work or have worked for the firm.

1. Why did you choose to work here? How long have you worked here? Why have you stayed?
2. Describe a typical day of work for you. How varied are your responsibilities?
3. What do you like the most about working at [COMPANY]?
4. What annoys you the most about working at [COMPANY]?
5. Do you enjoy the project you’re currently assigned on?
6. Is there flexibility to work on different projects from time to time?
7. How is the relationship with your team lead? Do you feel involved in the success of your team?
8. Tell me about a time things didn’t go as planned. How was the situation resolved? What measures were put in place to prevent this situation from occurring again?
9. Is there a bonus structure?
10. Does the company seem stable? Growth trajectory, on a road to acquisition, …
11. How does management evaluate your performance?
12. How much do you feel like you have learned from this work experience vs. how much have you contributed to the knowledge of the team/company.
13. Does the team plan or exercise for disaster recovery?
14. How much focus does your team have on security?
15. Every company gets criticized. What's a piece of criticism your company has received that you felt wasn't really accurate? What is some criticism that you agree with?
