# About me

Hello there! I'm a computer science engineer with interest in a wide range of  topics, including productivity, PKM, artificial intelligence, product development and game design.

I graduated from [Ghent University](http://www.ugent.be) in 2022 with a M.Sc. in Computer Science Engineering and Artificial Intelligence. For my Master dissertation, I researched the application of [Physical Reservoir Computing](https://doi.org/10.35848/1347-4065/ab8d4f) on physiological processes in plants.

In September 2022 I joined the team at [Qargo TMS](https://qargo.io), where I work to this day as a frontend engineer building a world-class, could-first transport management system.

I started this blog because I want to try writing as both a creative outlet, as well as to record some of my projects and various things I learn while programming. Some posts might be structured as how-to guides and notes for myself, while others will be more informative to record what I have learned.
